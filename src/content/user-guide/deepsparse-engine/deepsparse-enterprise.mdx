# DeepSparse Enterprise Edition

The DeepSparse Engine is available in two editions: 
1. **The Community Edition** is open-source and free for evaluation, research, and non-production use with our [Engine Community License](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/engine-license-agreement/).
2. **The Enterprise Edition** requires a Trial License or [can be fully licensed](https://neuralmagic.com/legal/master-software-license-and-service-agreement/) for production, commercial applications. 

## Installation
Install the Enterprise Edition as follows:

```bash
pip install deepsparse-ent
```

### Getting a License
The DeepSparse Enterprise Edition requires a valid license to run the engine and can be licensed for production, commercial applications. There are two options available:

#### 90-Day Enterprise Trial License
To try out the DeepSparse Enterprise Edition and get a Neural Magic Trial License, complete our [registration form](https://neuralmagic.com/deepsparse-engine-free-trial). Upon submission, the license will be emailed immediately to you and your 90-day term starts right then.

#### Enterprise Edition License
To learn more about DeepSparse Enterprise Edition pricing, [contact our Sales team](https://neuralmagic.com/deepsparse-engine/#form) to discuss your use case further for a custom quote.

### Installing a License
<details>
	<summary>Installing a License</summary>

Once you have obtained a license, you will need to initialize it to be able to run the DeepSparse Enterprise Edition. You can initialize your license by running the command: 

```bash
deepsparse.license
```

`deepsparse.license` takes one argument that is a reference to the license and can be referenced in the `deepsparse.license` command as either `<license_string>` or `path/to/license.txt`. 

To initialize a license on a machine:
1. Confirm you have deepsparse-ent installed in a fresh virtual environment. 
	- Note: Installing deepsparse and deepsparse-ent on the same virtual environment may result in unsupported behaviors. 
2. Run `deepsparse.license` with the `<license_string>` or `path/to/license.txt` as an argument as follows:
	- `deepsparse.license <samplelicensetring>`
	- `deepsparse.license ./license.txt`
3. If successful, `deepsparse.license` will write the license file to `~/.config/neuralmagic/license.txt`. You may overwrite this path by setting the environment variable `NM_CONFIG_DIR` (before and after running the script) with the following command:
	- `export NM_CONFIG_DIR=path/to/license.txt`

4. Once the license is authenticated, you should see a splash message indicating that you are now running DeepSparse Enterprise Edition.

### Validating a License
<details>
	<summary>Validating a License</summary>

Once you have initialized your license, you may want to check if it is still valid before running a workload on DeepSparse Enterprise Edition. To confirm your license is still active with the DeepSparse Enterprise Edition, run the command:

```bash
deepsparse.validate_license
```

`deepsparse.validate_license` can be run with no arguments, which will reference an existing environment variable (if set), or with one argument that is a reference to the license and can be referenced in the `deepsparse.validate_license` command as  `path/to/license.txt`. 

To validate a license on a machine:
1. If you have successfully ran `deepsparse.license`, `deepsparse.validate_license` can be used to validate that the license file is in the correct location:
	- Run the `deepsparse.validate_license` with no arguments. If the referenced license is valid, you should get the DeepSparse Enterprise Edition splash screen printed out in your terminal window.
	- If the `NM_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable was set when creating the license, ensure this variable is still set to the same value.
2. If you want to supply the `path/to/license.txt`:
	- Run the `deepsparse.validate_license` with `path/to/license.txt` as an argument as follows:
		- `deepsparse.validate_license --license_path path/to/license.txt`
	- If the referenced license is valid, you should get the DeepSparse Enterprise Edition splash screen printed out in your terminal window. 

If you encounter issues validating your DeepSparse Enterprise Edition License, contact [license@neuralmagic.com](mailto:license@neuralmagic.com) for help.
