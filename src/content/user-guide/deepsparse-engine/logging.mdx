# DeepSparse Logging

DeepSparse Logging provides operational teams with access to the telemetry needed to monitor a deployment. 

For users seeking to put ML into production, these data are the raw materials that underpin the monitoring processes needed to create a system with consistently fresh and accurate predictions.

There are many types of downstream monitoring tasks that ML teams may want to perform. Some are easier to do (such as looking at system performance) and some are harder (looking at model accuracy requires manually labeling some data afterwards). Examples include:
- **System performance:** what is the latency/throughput of a query?
- **Data quality:** is there an error in the model pipeline?
- **Data distribution shift:** are the inputs and outputs from the system expected?
- **Model accuracy:** what is the accuracy of the predictions vs human-labeled?

DeepSparse Logging is designed to provide maximum flexibility for users to extract whatever data is needed from a production inference pipeline into the logging system of their choice. 

## Metrics 
DeepSparse Logging provides access to two types of metrics:
- **System Logging Metrics** give operations teams access to granual performance metrics, diagnosing and isolating deployment system health. Examples include CPU utilization and query latency.
     - See below for a full list of available metrics.

- **Data Logging Metrics** give ML teams access to data at each stage of an ML pipeline, supporting downsteam tasks like measuring accuracy and data drift. Examples include raw inputs and projections thereof such as mean pixel value.
     - See below for a full list of built-in functions and how to create a custom function

## Configuration
DeepSparse Logging is configured via YAML files.

**System Logging** is *enabled* by default and all metrics are pre-defined. It can be disabled 
globally or at the group level by adding the key-value pairs with `on` or `off` status.
        
**Data Logging** is *disabled* by default. A YAML configuration file is used to specify which data or functions thereof to log. 
There are 4 `stages` in the inference pipeline where Data Logging can occur:

````
stages: pipeline_inputs >> engine_inputs >> engine_outputs >> pipeline_outputs
````

The following YAML format is used to specify the configuration:
```yaml
loggers:
 - prometheus
 - custom_logger

# system_logging: on/off    # flag to turn all system logging on/off; defaults to on
system_logging:
  group: on/off           # flag to turn off a group; if omitted, defaults to on
    
data_logging:
  stage:
    # first function
    - func: builtins:foo            # [REQUIRED STR] function identifier  (built-in or path to custom)
      frequency: 1000               # [OPTIONAL INT] logging frequency    (default: 1000 - logs once per 1000 predictions)
      target: all                   # [OPTIONAL STR] logger               (default: all)
    # second function
    - func: path/to/custom.py:bar  
      frequency: 10000
      target: prometheus
    # ... list of as many functions as desired
```

```yaml
loggers:
  - prometheus
  - custom_logger

system_logging:
  deployment_details: off
  request_details: off
  prediction_latency: on 
  dynamic_batch_latency: off
  # resource_utilization: on      << omitted groups are turned on by default
    
data_logging:
   pipeline_inputs:
     - func: builtins/max                        # built-in function
       frequency: 100                            # logs once per 100 predictions
       target: prometheus                        # logs to prometheus

     - func: /path/to/logging_fns.py:my_fn       # custom function
       # frequency:                              # not specified, defaults to once per 1000 predictions
       # target:                                 # not specified, defaults to all loggers

   engine_inputs:
     - func: builtins/channel-mean               # pre-defined function (logs per channel mean pixel)
       frequency: 10                             # logs once per 10 predictions
       # target:                                 # not specified, defaults to all loggers

   # engine_outputs:                               # not specified, so not logged
   # pipeline_outputs:                             # not specified, so not logged
```
This configuration does the following system logging:
- Deployment Details, Request Details, and Dynamic Batch Latency groups are turned off 
- Prediction Latency and Resource Utilization groups are turned on

This configuration does the following data logging at each respective stage of the pipeline:
- Pipeline Inputs: `xxx` data is logged to Prometheus once every 100 predictions and a custom function called `my_fn` is applied once every 1000 predictions and is logged to all loggers.
- Engine Inputs: The `xxx` function is applied once per 10 predictions and is logged to all loggers.
- Engine Outputs + Pipeline Outputs: No logging occurs at this stage

## Loggers
Logging to Prometheus works out-of-the-box and users can add custom loggers.

### Custom Logger

[@DAMIAN] - need your help here

There is a [tutorial creating a custom logger to an S3 Bucket](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse/tree/rs-logging-sdk/logging-sdk/tutorial-custom-logger) as an example.

## Usage 

Both the `Server` and `Pipeline` interfaces can run with logging.

### Server Usage

The startup command (`deepsparse.server`), accepts an optional YAML configuration file (which contains both logging-specific and general configuration details) via the `--config-file` argument. For example:

```bash
deepsparse.server --config-file server-config.yaml
```

The logging is configured as described above. System Logging is defined globally at the `Server` level while Data Logging is defined at the `Endpoint` level. In the example below, we create a `Server` with two `Endpoints` (one with a dense and one with a sparse BERT model).

<details>
    <summary>Click to see server-config.yaml </summary>
       
```yaml
# config.yaml

loggers:
 -prometheus
 -custom_logger

system_logging:
 deployment_details: off
 request_details: off
 prediction_latency: on 
 dynamic_batch_latency: off
 # resource_utilization:                    < not specified, so enabled by default

endpoints:
 - task: question_answering
   route: /dense/predict
   model: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/base-none
   batch_size: 1
   data_logging:
      - pipeline_inputs
          - func: builtins:sequence_length
            frequency: 500
            target: prometheus
                  
          - func: path/to/custom/metrics.py:fn2
            # frequency:                  < defaults to every 1000 inferences
            # target:                     < defaults to all
                  
       - engine_inputs
        - func: buildins:identity
          frequency: 1000
          target: custom_logger

       # - engine_outputs                 < nothing logged
       # - pipeline_outputs               < nothing logged
             
     - task: question_answering
       route: /sparse/predict
       model: zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/pruned95_obs_quant-none
       batch_size: 1
       # data_logging:                          < nothing logged at this endpoint 
```

</details>

### Pipeline Usage

The `ManagerLogger` class handles logging and is passed as the `logger` argument to a `Pipeline`. `ManagerLogger` is initialized with the `config` argument, which is a path to a configuration file in the format described above. 

For example, with the QA pipeline:

```python
from deepsparse import Pipeline

# SparseZoo model stub or path to ONNX file
model_path = "zoo:nlp/question_answering/bert-base/pytorch/huggingface/squad/12layer_pruned80_quant-none-vnni"

# logger object referencing the local logging config file
logger = ManagerLogger(config="pipeline-logging-config.yaml")

# pipeline instantiated with the config file
pipeline = Pipeline.create(
    task="question-answering",
    model_path=model_path,
    logger=logger
)

my_name = qa_pipeline(question="What's my name?", context="My name is Snorlax")
```

<details> 
    <summary>Click to see pipeline-logging-config.yaml</summary>
    
```yaml
# pipeline-logging-config.yaml

loggers:
     -prometheus
     -custom_logger

system_logging:
     deployment_details: off
     request_details: off
     prediction_latency: on 
     dynamic_batch_latency: off
     # resource_utilization:               < not specified, so enabled by default

data_logging:
  - pipeline_inputs
      - func: builtins:sequence_length
        frequency: 500
        target: prometheus
      - func: path/to/custom/metrics.py:fn2
        # frequency:                    < defaults to 1/1000 inferences
        # target:                       < defaults to all loggers
   
   - engine_inputs
      - func: buildins:identity
        frequency: 1000
        target: custom_logger
          
     # - engine_outputs           < not specified, so nothing logged at this target
     # - pipeline_outputs         < not specified, so nothing logged at this target
```
</details>

If no `ManagerLogger` is passed to a `Pipeline`, then logging is disabled.

## System Logging Metrics

**TO BE UPDATED** ONCE WE HAVE THE LIST OF METRICS FOR 1.3

### Metric Groups
The following metric groups are available:
- Prediction Latency (`prediction_latency`)
     
### Metrics
The following metrics are logged for each group:

#### Prediction Latency
Metric           |Metric Name              |Description                              |Granularity    |Usage  |Frequency      |
|---------------- |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------|---------------|
|Total Time       |`sl_pl_total_time`       |End-to-end prediction time               |Per Pipeline   |All    |Per Prediction |
|Preprocess Time  |`sl_pl_preprocess_time`  |Time spent in pre-processing step        |Per Pipeline   |All    |Per Prediction |
|Engine Time      |`sl_pl_engine_time`      |Time spent in engine forward pass        |Per Pipeline   |All    |Per Prediction |
|Postprocess Time |`sl_pl_postprocess_time` |Time spent in post-processing step       |Per Pipeline   |All    |Per Prediction |


##  Data Logging Functions

**TO BE UPDATED** ONCE WE HAVE LIST FOR 1.3
  
### Built-in Functions

Built-in functions are predefined in DeepSparse. 
   
|Function Name  |Description                        |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
|`mean_pixel_1` |Mean pixel value in first channel  |
|`mean_pixel_2` |Mean pixel value in second channel |
|`mean_pixel_3` |Mean pixel value in third channel  |

They are applied in the form `func: builtins/function_name`. The YAML file would look as follows:
``` yaml
# config.yaml
  
loggers:
  prometheus:
    port:5555
  
data_logging:
  pipeline_inputs:
    - func: builtin:function
      frequency: 1000
      target: prometheus
``` 

### Custom Functions

Users can define custom functions in Python in a file, for example `custom.py`.
  
```python
# custom.py

import numpy as np

def my_function(engine_inputs: np.array) -> float:
  return np.mean(engine_inputs)
```

The custom functions are then specified in the YAML configuration file in the form `func: path/to/custom.py:function_name`:
``` yaml
# config.yaml
  
loggers:
  prometheus:
    port:5555
  
data_logging:
  pipeline_inputs:
    - func: path/to/custom.py:my_function
      frequency: 1000
      target: prometheus
```
