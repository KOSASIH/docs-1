# Neural Magic Documentation

Neural Magic's Deep Sparse Platform provides a suite of software components to train and deploy deep learning models performantly on your data.

The [DeepSparse Engine](/products/deepsparse) offers best-in-class CPU performance for dense and sparsified models.
Specifically for sparsified models, it offers better than GPU performance for many use cases.
The performance is achieved by leveraging proprietary technology around the unique cache hierarchy of CPUs for faster memory access, and sparsification techniques to increase the effective compute on CPUs.

[SparseML](/products/sparseml) contains state-of-the-art [sparsification algorithms](/user-guide/sparsification) and techniques to enable simple creation of sparsified models.
The sparsification algorithms are built on top of [recipes](/user-guide/recipes), which encode instructions and hyperparams for sparsifying models, enabling this functionality in most pipelines with only a few lines of code.

The [SparseZoo](/products/sparsezoo) stores dense and presparsified models ready for testing, deployment, and fine-tuning onto your data.
SparseZoo stubs enable you to reference any model on the SparseZoo in a convenient and identifiable way.
They are found throughout the documentation and the model pages on the [SparseZoo Website](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com).
